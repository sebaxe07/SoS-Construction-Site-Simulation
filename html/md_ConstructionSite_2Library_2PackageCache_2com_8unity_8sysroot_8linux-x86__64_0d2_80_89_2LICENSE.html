<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>
<div class="line">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</div>

<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</div>
<div class="line"> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</div>
<div class="line"> the version number 2.1.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations</div>
<div class="line">below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line">^L</div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it</div>
<div class="line">becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must</div>
<div class="line">be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>
<div class="line">^L</div>
<div class="line">                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control</div>
<div class="line">compilation and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line">^L</div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line">^L</div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least</div>
<div class="line">    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in</div>
<div class="line">    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of</div>
<div class="line">    performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line">^L</div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line">^L</div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those</div>
<div class="line">countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line">^L</div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>

<div class="line">                            NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>

<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms</div>
<div class="line">of the ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.</div>
<div class="line">It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most</div>
<div class="line">effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should</div>
<div class="line">have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full</div>
<div class="line">notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>

<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>
<div class="line">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</div>
<div class="line">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</div>
<div class="line">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>
<div class="line">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>

<div class="line">59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</div>
<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is</div>
<div class="line"> numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any</div>
<div class="line">other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for</div>
<div class="line">your libraries, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if</div>
<div class="line">you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright</div>
<div class="line">the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original</div>
<div class="line">version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on</div>
<div class="line">the original authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free</div>
<div class="line">software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect</div>
<div class="line">transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,</div>
<div class="line">we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This</div>
<div class="line">license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain</div>
<div class="line">designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is</div>
<div class="line">the same as in the ordinary license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</div>
<div class="line">they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</div>
<div class="line">program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</div>
<div class="line">changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</div>
<div class="line">analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</div>
<div class="line">a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</div>
<div class="line">derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</div>
<div class="line">treats it as such.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</div>
<div class="line">sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</div>
<div class="line">concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</div>
<div class="line">users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</div>
<div class="line">libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</div>
<div class="line">permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</div>
<div class="line">preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</div>
<div class="line">libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</div>
<div class="line">this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</div>
<div class="line">changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</div>
<div class="line">will lead to faster development of free libraries.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</div>
<div class="line">works together with the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License rather than by this special one.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">          GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which</div>
<div class="line">contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized</div>
<div class="line">party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library</div>
<div class="line">General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is</div>
<div class="line">addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</div>
<div class="line">distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>
<div class="line">and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>
<div class="line">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</div>
<div class="line">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</div>
<div class="line">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</div>
<div class="line">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</div>
<div class="line">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</div>
<div class="line">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</div>
<div class="line">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</div>
<div class="line">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</div>
<div class="line">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</div>
<div class="line">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</div>
<div class="line">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</div>
<div class="line">LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING</div>
<div class="line">RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A</div>
<div class="line">FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF</div>

<div class="line">DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div>
<div class="line">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</div>
<div class="line">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>

<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</div>
<div class="line"> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</div>
<div class="line"> the version number 2.1.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</div>
<div class="line">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</div>
<div class="line">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>

<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>

<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div>
<div class="line">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</div>
<div class="line">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>

<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>

<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>
<div class="line">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</div>
<div class="line">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</div>
<div class="line">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>
<div class="line">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify</div>
<div class="line">    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</div>
<div class="line">    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</div>
<div class="line">    (at your option) any later version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</div>
<div class="line">    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</div>
<div class="line">    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</div>
<div class="line">    GNU General Public License for more details.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along</div>
<div class="line">    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,</div>
<div class="line">    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this</div>
<div class="line">when it starts in an interactive mode:</div>

<div class="line">    under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate</div>
<div class="line">parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may</div>
<div class="line">be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be</div>
<div class="line">mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your</div>
<div class="line">school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if</div>
<div class="line">necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</div>

<div class="line">This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into</div>

<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</div>
<div class="line"> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</div>
<div class="line"> the version number 2.1.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</div>
<div class="line">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</div>
<div class="line">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>

<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations</div>
<div class="line">below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it</div>
<div class="line">becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must</div>
<div class="line">be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>

<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control</div>
<div class="line">compilation and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least</div>
<div class="line">    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in</div>
<div class="line">    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of</div>
<div class="line">    performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those</div>
<div class="line">countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>
<div class="line">and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>
<div class="line">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</div>
<div class="line">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</div>
<div class="line">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</div>
<div class="line">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</div>
<div class="line">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</div>
<div class="line">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</div>
<div class="line">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</div>
<div class="line">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</div>
<div class="line">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</div>
<div class="line">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</div>
<div class="line">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</div>
<div class="line">LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING</div>
<div class="line">RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A</div>
<div class="line">FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF</div>
<div class="line">SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</div>
<div class="line">DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms</div>
<div class="line">of the ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.</div>
<div class="line">It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most</div>
<div class="line">effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should</div>
<div class="line">have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full</div>
<div class="line">notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or</div>
<div class="line">    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public</div>
<div class="line">    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either</div>

<div class="line">  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG</div>

<div class="line">  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products</div>
<div class="line">  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    o We don&#39;t promise that this software works. However, we will be</div>
<div class="line">      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#39; distribution)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or</div>
<div class="line">      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#39; usage)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>

<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>

<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>

<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>

<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>

<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>

<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>

<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>

<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>
<div class="line">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</div>
<div class="line">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</div>
<div class="line">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>
<div class="line">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify</div>
<div class="line">    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</div>
<div class="line">    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</div>
<div class="line">    (at your option) any later version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</div>
<div class="line">    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</div>

<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</div>
<div class="line"> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</div>
<div class="line"> the version number 2.1.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</div>
<div class="line">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</div>
<div class="line">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>
<div class="line">and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>
<div class="line">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</div>
<div class="line">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</div>

<div class="line">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</div>
<div class="line">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</div>
<div class="line">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</div>

<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div>
<div class="line">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</div>
<div class="line">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>

<div class="line">This Academic Free License (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the &quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a</div>
<div class="line">world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable</div>
<div class="line">license to do the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">b) to prepare derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon the Original Work;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">e) to display the Original Work publicly.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,</div>
<div class="line">royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under</div>
<div class="line">patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in</div>
<div class="line">the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and</div>
<div class="line">offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the</div>
<div class="line">preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and</div>
<div class="line">all available documentation describing how to modify the Original</div>
<div class="line">Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the</div>
<div class="line">Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original</div>
<div class="line">Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy</div>
<div class="line">this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code</div>
<div class="line">in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit</div>
<div class="line">inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor</div>
<div class="line">continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the</div>
<div class="line">address of that information repository in a notice immediately</div>
<div class="line">following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor</div>
<div class="line">the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their</div>
<div class="line">trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote</div>
<div class="line">products derived from this Original Work without express prior written</div>

<div class="line">herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to</div>

<div class="line">defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of</div>
<div class="line">Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing</div>
<div class="line">in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from</div>
<div class="line">licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work</div>
<div class="line">that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">5) This section intentionally omitted.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any</div>
<div class="line">Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark</div>
<div class="line">notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any</div>

<div class="line">&quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any</div>

<div class="line">Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have</div>
<div class="line">modified the Original Work.</div>

<div class="line">7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor</div>
<div class="line">warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent</div>
<div class="line">rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are</div>
<div class="line">sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission</div>
<div class="line">of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as</div>
<div class="line">expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original</div>
<div class="line">Work is provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT</div>
<div class="line">WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,</div>
<div class="line">the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A</div>
<div class="line">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL</div>
<div class="line">WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential</div>
<div class="line">part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder</div>
<div class="line">except under this disclaimer.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal</div>
<div class="line">theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,</div>
<div class="line">indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any</div>
<div class="line">character arising as a result of this License or the use of the</div>
<div class="line">Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of</div>
<div class="line">goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and</div>
<div class="line">all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability</div>
<div class="line">shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting</div>
<div class="line">from Licensor&#39;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such</div>
<div class="line">limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or</div>
<div class="line">limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion</div>
<div class="line">and limitation may not apply to You.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the</div>
<div class="line">Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort</div>
<div class="line">under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to</div>
<div class="line">the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another</div>
<div class="line">written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to</div>
<div class="line">create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise</div>
<div class="line">any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do</div>
<div class="line">so except under the terms of this License (or another written</div>
<div class="line">agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by</div>
<div class="line">U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by</div>
<div class="line">international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights</div>
<div class="line">granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of</div>
<div class="line">this License and all of its terms and conditions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate</div>
<div class="line">automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted</div>
<div class="line">to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,</div>
<div class="line">including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any</div>
<div class="line">licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This</div>
<div class="line">termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software</div>
<div class="line">or hardware.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating</div>
<div class="line">to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction</div>
<div class="line">wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary</div>
<div class="line">business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its</div>
<div class="line">conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations</div>
<div class="line">Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is</div>
<div class="line">expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of</div>
<div class="line">this License or after its termination shall be subject to the</div>
<div class="line">requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 101</div>
<div class="line">et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international</div>
<div class="line">treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License</div>
<div class="line">or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be</div>
<div class="line">entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without</div>
<div class="line">limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in</div>
<div class="line">connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This</div>
<div class="line">section shall survive the termination of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement</div>
<div class="line">concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License</div>
<div class="line">is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to</div>
<div class="line">the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">14) Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License. &quot;You&quot; throughout this</div>
<div class="line">License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a</div>
<div class="line">legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the</div>
<div class="line">terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity</div>
<div class="line">that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with</div>
<div class="line">you. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power,</div>
<div class="line">direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such</div>
<div class="line">entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty</div>
<div class="line">percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial</div>
<div class="line">ownership of such entity.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not</div>
<div class="line">otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and</div>
<div class="line">Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such</div>
<div class="line">uses by You.</div>

<div class="line">-- </div>
<div class="line">END OF ACADEMIC FREE LICENSE. The following is intended to describe the essential </div>
<div class="line">differences between the Academic Free License (AFL) version 1.0 and other </div>
<div class="line">open source licenses:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The Academic Free License is similar to the BSD, MIT, UoI/NCSA and Apache </div>
<div class="line">licenses in many respects but it is intended to solve a few problems with </div>
<div class="line">those licenses.</div>
<div class="line">    </div>
<div class="line">* The AFL is written so as to make it clear what software is being </div>
<div class="line">licensed (by the inclusion of a statement following the copyright notice </div>
<div class="line">in the software). This way, the license functions better than a template </div>
<div class="line">license. The BSD, MIT and UoI/NCSA licenses apply to unidentified software.</div>
<div class="line">    </div>
<div class="line">* The AFL contains a complete copyright grant to the software. The BSD </div>
<div class="line">and Apache licenses are vague and incomplete in that respect.</div>
<div class="line">    </div>
<div class="line">* The AFL contains a complete patent grant to the software. The BSD, MIT, </div>
<div class="line">UoI/NCSA and Apache licenses rely on an implied patent license and contain </div>
<div class="line">no explicit patent grant.</div>
<div class="line">    </div>
<div class="line">* The AFL makes it clear that no trademark rights are granted to the </div>
<div class="line">licensor&#39;s trademarks. The Apache license contains such a provision, but the </div>
<div class="line">BSD, MIT and UoI/NCSA licenses do not.</div>
<div class="line">    </div>
<div class="line">* The AFL includes the warranty by the licensor that it either owns the </div>
<div class="line">copyright or that it is distributing the software under a license. None of </div>
<div class="line">the other licenses contain that warranty. All other warranties are disclaimed, </div>
<div class="line">as is the case for the other licenses.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">* The AFL is itself copyrighted (with the right granted to copy and distribute </div>
<div class="line">without modification). This ensures that the owner of the copyright to the </div>
<div class="line">license will control changes. The Apache license contains a copyright notice, </div>
<div class="line">but the BSD, MIT and UoI/NCSA licenses do not. </div>
<div class="line">--</div>
<div class="line">START OF GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</div>
<div class="line">51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>
<div class="line">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</div>
<div class="line">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</div>
<div class="line">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>
<div class="line">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</div>

<div class="line">    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</div>
<div class="line">    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</div>
<div class="line">    (at your option) any later version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</div>
<div class="line">    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</div>
<div class="line">    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</div>
<div class="line">    GNU General Public License for more details.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</div>

<div class="line">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your</div>

<div class="line">This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into</div>

<div class="line">3. Unless you are doing PS3 (PSl1ght) development any libraries or</div>
<div class="line">applications you write that use EFL are yours and you do not need to</div>
<div class="line">make the source available. That means if you link to EFL dynamically.</div>
<div class="line">If you copy in EFL source into your application or library or</div>
<div class="line">statically link, then you will need to provide full source of whatever</div>
<div class="line">statically links or copies any of this software into yours.</div>
<div class="line">4. If you made changes to EFL it would be appreciated if you</div>
<div class="line">interacted with us (see http://www.enlightenment.org) and provided the</div>
<div class="line">changes you made in patch form BEFORE you ship a product, so they may</div>
<div class="line">be reviewed to see if you have made any mistakes and perhaps have</div>
<div class="line">created problems you do not know of yet.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">F.A.Q.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Q. Where is the licensing information?</div>
<div class="line">A. See the COPYING file here and then the COPYING.* files inside the</div>
<div class="line">licenses directory that it references. These are the proper legal</div>
<div class="line">pieces of information you will need.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Q. Do I need to make the source public of libraries or applications that I</div>
<div class="line">build on top of EFL?</div>
<div class="line">A. No, UNLESS you use the escape library. Escape is GPL. This is ONLY</div>
<div class="line">needed for PS3 development, so unless you are doing this, it is not</div>
<div class="line">relevant.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Q. Do I need to provide the source for EFL?</div>
<div class="line">A. Yes. In general you do. If you are shipping any of the binaries or</div>
<div class="line">libraries that are produced, you must provide the EXACT source code</div>
<div class="line">used to build those binaries.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Q. If I have to provide source, how should I do this?</div>
<div class="line">A. The best way is to provide a reference in an &quot;about&quot; dialog in the</div>
<div class="line">product that ships the EFL libraries/tools that gives a URL from</div>
<div class="line">which the source can be downloaded EXACTLY as you used to compile EFL.</div>
<div class="line">You may not simply point to upstream repositories and pass the problem</div>
<div class="line">to someone else. You MUST provide the source exactly as used.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You MAY also provide the source code itself on the product itself</div>
<div class="line">(e.g. on its filesystem) (provide the tar archives of the source), or in</div>
<div class="line">place of a download link if you do not believe you will be able to</div>
<div class="line">maintain that download link for the lifetime of the product.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You MAY also (or instead of the above 2) provide the source on media</div>
<div class="line">(CD, DVD, flash etc.) that accompany the product.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Choose 1 or more of the above methods and you will be fine.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Q. Do I need to reproduce the license information in the COPYING* files?</div>
<div class="line">A. Yes. You must provide these with your product, and just like the</div>
<div class="line">source code, provide them as part of the user interface in full (e.g.</div>
<div class="line">in a dialog), or as files in the filesystem, on actual printed</div>
<div class="line">material (manuals, papers) that accompany the product or in CD, DVD</div>
<div class="line">etc. media.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Q. Is there a simpler list of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts i can use?</div>
<div class="line">A. Yes. See http://www.tldrlegal.com. specifically:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">http://www.tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-2-clause-license-(freebsd)</div>

<div class="line">============</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;</div>
<div class="line">  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,</div>
<div class="line">  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the</div>
<div class="line">  FreeType Project.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and</div>
<div class="line">  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license</div>
<div class="line">  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,</div>
<div class="line">  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG</div>
<div class="line">  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion</div>
<div class="line">  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products</div>
<div class="line">  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    o We don&#39;t promise that this software works. However, we will be</div>
<div class="line">      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#39; distribution)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or</div>
<div class="line">      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#39; usage)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use</div>
<div class="line">      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge</div>
<div class="line">      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the</div>
<div class="line">      FreeType code. (`credits&#39;)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this</div>
<div class="line">  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.</div>

<div class="line">  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a</div>
<div class="line">  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus</div>
<div class="line">  encourage you to use the following text:</div>

<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>

<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>
<div class="line">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</div>
<div class="line">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</div>
<div class="line">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>
<div class="line">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>

<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</div>
<div class="line">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</div>
<div class="line">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is</div>
<div class="line">making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you</div>
<div class="line">permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an</div>
<div class="line">executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,</div>
<div class="line">and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your</div>
<div class="line">choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,</div>
<div class="line">the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent</div>
<div class="line">module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.</div>
<div class="line">If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version</div>
<div class="line">of the library, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to</div>
<div class="line">do so, delete this exception statement from your version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>
<div class="line">and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>
<div class="line">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</div>
<div class="line">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</div>
<div class="line">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</div>
<div class="line">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</div>
<div class="line">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</div>
<div class="line">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</div>
<div class="line">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</div>
<div class="line">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</div>
<div class="line">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</div>
<div class="line">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</div>
<div class="line">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs</div>

<div class="line">  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo</div>
<div class="line">  SIMD extensions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses</div>
<div class="line">=========================================</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the</div>
<div class="line">best of our understanding.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,</div>
<div class="line">    then:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices</div>
<div class="line">        from the source.</div>

<div class="line">        - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source</div>
<div class="line">        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if</div>
<div class="line">        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can</div>
<div class="line">        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        **Origin**</div>
<div class="line">        - Clause 1 of the IJG License</div>
<div class="line">        - Clause 2 of the zlib License</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">        **Origin**</div>
<div class="line">        - Clause 1 of the IJG License</div>

<div class="line">2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or</div>
<div class="line">    if you are distributing an application that statically links with</div>
<div class="line">    libjpeg-turbo, then:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>

<div class="line">        your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Why Three Licenses?</div>
<div class="line">===================</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD</div>
<div class="line">License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution</div>
<div class="line">conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed</div>
<div class="line">libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG</div>
<div class="line">License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend</div>
<div class="line">attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was</div>
<div class="line">desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code</div>
<div class="line">that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.</div>

<div class="line">OVERVIEW</div>
<div class="line">========</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,</div>
<div class="line">and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced &quot;jay-peg&quot;) is a standardized compression</div>
<div class="line">method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG&#39;s strong suit is compressing</div>
<div class="line">photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and</div>
<div class="line">brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or</div>
<div class="line">other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG</div>
<div class="line">quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such</div>
<div class="line">images.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to</div>
<div class="line">the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other &quot;smooth&quot; images,</div>
<div class="line">very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression</div>
<div class="line">artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are</div>
<div class="line">willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the &quot;quality&quot; setting in the</div>
<div class="line">compressor.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive</div>
<div class="line">compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these</div>
<div class="line">processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren&#39;t implemented yet.</div>
<div class="line">We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless</div>
<div class="line">processes defined in the standard.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,</div>
<div class="line">plus two sample applications &quot;cjpeg&quot; and &quot;djpeg&quot;, which use the library to</div>
<div class="line">perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.</div>
<div class="line">The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included</div>
<div class="line">considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;</div>
<div class="line">for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG</div>
<div class="line">decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or</div>
<div class="line">colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the</div>
<div class="line">library if not required for a particular application.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">We have also included &quot;jpegtran&quot;, a utility for lossless transcoding between</div>
<div class="line">different JPEG processes, and &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot;, two simple</div>
<div class="line">applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and</div>
<div class="line">flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,</div>
<div class="line">the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the</div>
<div class="line">REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to</div>
<div class="line">be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have</div>
<div class="line">achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.</div>
<div class="line">No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product</div>
<div class="line">documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.</div>

<div class="line">        Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.</div>
<div class="line">(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,</div>
<div class="line">applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don&#39;t have the CACM issue</div>
<div class="line">handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace&#39;s article is</div>
<div class="line">available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually</div>
<div class="line">a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)</div>

<div class="line">and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,</div>
<div class="line">and it may not be used for commercial purposes.</div>

<div class="line">M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides</div>
<div class="line">good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods</div>
<div class="line">including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C</div>
<div class="line">code but don&#39;t know much about data compression in general.  The book&#39;s JPEG</div>
<div class="line">sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook &quot;JPEG Still</div>

<div class="line">standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual</div>
<div class="line">specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is</div>
<div class="line">titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,</div>
<div class="line">Part 1: Requirements and guidelines&quot; and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS</div>
<div class="line">10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of</div>
<div class="line">Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing&quot; and has document</div>
<div class="line">numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file</div>
<div class="line">format.  For the omitted details, we follow the &quot;JFIF&quot; conventions, revision</div>
<div class="line">1.02.  JFIF version 1 has been adopted as ISO/IEC 10918-5 (05/2013) and</div>
<div class="line">Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011): Information technology - Digital</div>
<div class="line">compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange</div>
<div class="line">Format (JFIF).  It is available as a free download in PDF file format from</div>

<div class="line">The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from</div>
<div class="line">ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme</div>
<div class="line">found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.</div>
<div class="line">IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).</div>
<div class="line">Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2</div>
<div class="line">(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from</div>
<div class="line">http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision</div>
<div class="line">of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note&#39;s design.</div>
<div class="line">Although IJG&#39;s own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library</div>
<div class="line">uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.</div>

<div class="line">This software implements ITU T.81 | ISO/IEC 10918 with some extensions from</div>
<div class="line">ITU T.871 | ISO/IEC 10918-5 (JPEG File Interchange Format-- see REFERENCES).</div>
<div class="line">Informally, the term &quot;JPEG image&quot; or &quot;JPEG file&quot; most often refers to JFIF or</div>
<div class="line">a subset thereof, but there are other formats containing the name &quot;JPEG&quot; that</div>
<div class="line">are incompatible with the DCT-based JPEG standard or with JFIF (for instance,</div>
<div class="line">JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR).  This software therefore does not support these</div>
<div class="line">formats.  Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software</div>
<div class="line">was to help force convergence on a common, interoperable format standard for</div>
<div class="line">JPEG files.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">JFIF is a minimal or &quot;low end&quot; representation.  TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as</div>
<div class="line">modified by TIFF Technical Note #2) can be used for &quot;high end&quot; applications</div>

<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>
<div class="line">TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</div>
<div class="line">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</div>
<div class="line">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>
<div class="line">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>
<div class="line">    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify</div>
<div class="line">    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</div>
<div class="line">    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</div>
<div class="line">    (at your option) any later version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</div>
<div class="line">    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</div>
<div class="line">    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</div>
<div class="line">    GNU General Public License for more details.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along</div>
<div class="line">    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</div>

<div class="line">mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your</div>

<div class="line">This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into</div>

<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if</div>
<div class="line">you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright</div>
<div class="line">the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original</div>
<div class="line">version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on</div>
<div class="line">the original authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free</div>
<div class="line">software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect</div>
<div class="line">transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,</div>
<div class="line">we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This</div>
<div class="line">license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain</div>
<div class="line">designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is</div>
<div class="line">the same as in the ordinary license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</div>
<div class="line">they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</div>
<div class="line">program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</div>
<div class="line">changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</div>
<div class="line">analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</div>
<div class="line">a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</div>
<div class="line">derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</div>
<div class="line">treats it as such.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</div>
<div class="line">sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</div>
<div class="line">concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</div>
<div class="line">users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</div>
<div class="line">libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</div>
<div class="line">permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</div>
<div class="line">preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</div>
<div class="line">libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</div>
<div class="line">this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</div>
<div class="line">changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</div>
<div class="line">will lead to faster development of free libraries.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</div>
<div class="line">works together with the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License rather than by this special one.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">          GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which</div>
<div class="line">contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized</div>
<div class="line">party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library</div>
<div class="line">General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is</div>
<div class="line">addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</div>
<div class="line">distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.</div>

<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if</div>
<div class="line">you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright</div>
<div class="line">the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original</div>
<div class="line">version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on</div>
<div class="line">the original authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free</div>
<div class="line">software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect</div>
<div class="line">transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,</div>
<div class="line">we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This</div>
<div class="line">license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain</div>
<div class="line">designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is</div>
<div class="line">the same as in the ordinary license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</div>
<div class="line">they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</div>
<div class="line">program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</div>
<div class="line">changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</div>
<div class="line">analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</div>
<div class="line">a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</div>
<div class="line">derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</div>
<div class="line">treats it as such.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</div>
<div class="line">sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</div>
<div class="line">concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</div>
<div class="line">users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</div>
<div class="line">libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</div>
<div class="line">permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</div>
<div class="line">preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</div>
<div class="line">libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</div>
<div class="line">this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</div>
<div class="line">changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</div>
<div class="line">will lead to faster development of free libraries.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</div>
<div class="line">works together with the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License rather than by this special one.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which</div>
<div class="line">contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized</div>
<div class="line">party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library</div>
<div class="line">General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is</div>
<div class="line">addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</div>
<div class="line">distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.</div>

<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>

<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div>
<div class="line">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</div>
<div class="line">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>

<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is</div>
<div class="line"> numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any</div>
<div class="line">other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for</div>
<div class="line">your libraries, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if</div>
<div class="line">you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright</div>
<div class="line">the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original</div>
<div class="line">version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on</div>
<div class="line">the original authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free</div>
<div class="line">software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect</div>
<div class="line">transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,</div>
<div class="line">we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This</div>
<div class="line">license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain</div>
<div class="line">designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is</div>
<div class="line">the same as in the ordinary license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</div>
<div class="line">they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</div>
<div class="line">program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</div>
<div class="line">changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</div>
<div class="line">analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</div>
<div class="line">a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</div>
<div class="line">derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</div>
<div class="line">treats it as such.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</div>
<div class="line">sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</div>
<div class="line">concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</div>
<div class="line">users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</div>
<div class="line">libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</div>
<div class="line">permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</div>
<div class="line">preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</div>
<div class="line">libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</div>
<div class="line">this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</div>
<div class="line">changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</div>
<div class="line">will lead to faster development of free libraries.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</div>
<div class="line">works together with the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License rather than by this special one.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">          GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which</div>
<div class="line">contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized</div>
<div class="line">party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library</div>
<div class="line">General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is</div>
<div class="line">addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line">  </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</div>
<div class="line">distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>
<div class="line">and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>
<div class="line">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</div>
<div class="line">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</div>
<div class="line">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</div>
<div class="line">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</div>
<div class="line">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</div>
<div class="line">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</div>
<div class="line">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</div>
<div class="line">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</div>
<div class="line">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</div>
<div class="line">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</div>
<div class="line">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</div>

<div class="line">DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div>
<div class="line">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</div>
<div class="line">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>

<div class="line">Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</div>
<div class="line">51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</div>
<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</div>
<div class="line">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</div>
<div class="line">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</div>
<div class="line">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</div>
<div class="line">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</div>
<div class="line">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</div>
<div class="line">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</div>
<div class="line">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</div>
<div class="line">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</div>
<div class="line">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</div>
<div class="line">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</div>
<div class="line">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</div>
<div class="line">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</div>
<div class="line">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</div>
<div class="line">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</div>
<div class="line">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</div>
<div class="line">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</div>
<div class="line">OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</div>

<div class="line">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</div>

<div class="line">        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>
<div class="line">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</div>
<div class="line">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>

<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</div>
<div class="line"> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</div>
<div class="line"> the version number 2.1.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations</div>
<div class="line">below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it</div>
<div class="line">becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must</div>
<div class="line">be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>

<div class="line">                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control</div>
<div class="line">compilation and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least</div>
<div class="line">    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in</div>
<div class="line">    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of</div>
<div class="line">    performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those</div>
<div class="line">countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>
<div class="line">and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>
<div class="line">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</div>
<div class="line">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</div>
<div class="line">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</div>
<div class="line">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</div>
<div class="line">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</div>
<div class="line">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</div>
<div class="line">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</div>
<div class="line">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</div>
<div class="line">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</div>
<div class="line">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</div>
<div class="line">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</div>
<div class="line">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</div>

<div class="line">SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</div>
<div class="line">DAMAGES.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms</div>
<div class="line">of the ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.</div>
<div class="line">It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most</div>
<div class="line">effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should</div>
<div class="line">have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full</div>
<div class="line">notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>

<div class="line">&quot;GCC&quot; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without</div>

<div class="line">                       Version 3, 29 June 2007</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</div>
<div class="line">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</div>
<div class="line">software and other kinds of works.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</div>
<div class="line">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</div>
<div class="line">the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</div>
<div class="line">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</div>
<div class="line">software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</div>
<div class="line">any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</div>
<div class="line">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</div>
<div class="line">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</div>
<div class="line">these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</div>
<div class="line">certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</div>
<div class="line">you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</div>
<div class="line">freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</div>
<div class="line">or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</div>
<div class="line">know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</div>
<div class="line">(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</div>
<div class="line">giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains</div>
<div class="line">that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</div>
<div class="line">changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</div>
<div class="line">authors of previous versions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</div>
<div class="line">modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</div>
<div class="line">can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</div>
<div class="line">protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic</div>
<div class="line">pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</div>
<div class="line">use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</div>
<div class="line">have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</div>
<div class="line">products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</div>
<div class="line">stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</div>
<div class="line">of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</div>
<div class="line">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</div>
<div class="line">software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</div>
<div class="line">avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</div>
<div class="line">make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</div>
<div class="line">patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. Definitions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</div>
<div class="line">works, such as semiconductor masks.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</div>
<div class="line">License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</div>
<div class="line">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</div>
<div class="line">exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</div>
<div class="line">earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</div>
<div class="line">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</div>
<div class="line">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</div>
<div class="line">computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</div>
<div class="line">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</div>
<div class="line">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</div>
<div class="line">parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</div>
<div class="line">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</div>
<div class="line">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</div>
<div class="line">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</div>
<div class="line">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</div>
<div class="line">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</div>
<div class="line">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</div>
<div class="line">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. Source Code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</div>
<div class="line">for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</div>
<div class="line">form of a work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</div>
<div class="line">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</div>
<div class="line">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</div>
<div class="line">is widely used among developers working in that language.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</div>
<div class="line">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</div>
<div class="line">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</div>
<div class="line">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</div>
<div class="line">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</div>
<div class="line">implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</div>
<div class="line">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</div>
<div class="line">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</div>
<div class="line">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</div>
<div class="line">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</div>
<div class="line">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</div>
<div class="line">control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</div>
<div class="line">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</div>
<div class="line">which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</div>
<div class="line">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</div>
<div class="line">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</div>
<div class="line">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</div>
<div class="line">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</div>
<div class="line">subprograms and other parts of the work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</div>
<div class="line">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</div>
<div class="line">Source.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</div>
<div class="line">same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. Basic Permissions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</div>
<div class="line">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</div>
<div class="line">conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</div>
<div class="line">permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</div>
<div class="line">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</div>
<div class="line">content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</div>
<div class="line">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</div>
<div class="line">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</div>
<div class="line">in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</div>
<div class="line">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</div>
<div class="line">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</div>
<div class="line">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</div>
<div class="line">not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</div>
<div class="line">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</div>
<div class="line">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</div>
<div class="line">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</div>
<div class="line">the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</div>
<div class="line">makes it unnecessary.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</div>
<div class="line">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</div>
<div class="line">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</div>
<div class="line">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</div>
<div class="line">measures.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</div>
<div class="line">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</div>
<div class="line">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</div>
<div class="line">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</div>
<div class="line">technological measures.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you</div>
<div class="line">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</div>
<div class="line">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</div>
<div class="line">keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</div>
<div class="line">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</div>
<div class="line">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</div>
<div class="line">recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</div>
<div class="line">and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</div>
<div class="line">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</div>
<div class="line">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</div>
<div class="line">    it, and giving a relevant date.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</div>
<div class="line">    released under this License and any conditions added under section</div>
<div class="line">    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</div>
<div class="line">    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</div>
<div class="line">    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</div>
<div class="line">    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</div>
<div class="line">    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</div>
<div class="line">    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</div>
<div class="line">    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</div>
<div class="line">    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</div>
<div class="line">    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</div>
<div class="line">    work need not make them do so.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</div>
<div class="line">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</div>
<div class="line">and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</div>
<div class="line">in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</div>
<div class="line">&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</div>
<div class="line">used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users</div>
<div class="line">beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</div>
<div class="line">in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</div>
<div class="line">parts of the aggregate.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</div>
<div class="line">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</div>
<div class="line">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</div>
<div class="line">in one of these ways:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</div>
<div class="line">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</div>
<div class="line">    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</div>
<div class="line">    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</div>
<div class="line">    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</div>
<div class="line">    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</div>
<div class="line">    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</div>
<div class="line">    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</div>
<div class="line">    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</div>
<div class="line">    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</div>
<div class="line">    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</div>
<div class="line">    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</div>
<div class="line">    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</div>
<div class="line">    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</div>
<div class="line">    with subsection 6b.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</div>
<div class="line">    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</div>
<div class="line">    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</div>
<div class="line">    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</div>
<div class="line">    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</div>
<div class="line">    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</div>
<div class="line">    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</div>
<div class="line">    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</div>
<div class="line">    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</div>
<div class="line">    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</div>
<div class="line">    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</div>
<div class="line">    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</div>
<div class="line">    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge under subsection 6d.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</div>
<div class="line">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</div>
<div class="line">included in conveying the object code work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</div>
<div class="line">tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</div>
<div class="line">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</div>
<div class="line">into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</div>
<div class="line">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</div>
<div class="line">product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</div>
<div class="line">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</div>
<div class="line">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</div>
<div class="line">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</div>
<div class="line">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</div>
<div class="line">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</div>
<div class="line">the only significant mode of use of the product.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</div>
<div class="line">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</div>
<div class="line">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</div>
<div class="line">a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</div>
<div class="line">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</div>
<div class="line">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</div>
<div class="line">modification has been made.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</div>
<div class="line">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</div>
<div class="line">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</div>
<div class="line">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</div>
<div class="line">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</div>
<div class="line">by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</div>
<div class="line">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</div>
<div class="line">modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</div>
<div class="line">been installed in ROM).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</div>
<div class="line">requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</div>
<div class="line">for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</div>
<div class="line">the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</div>
<div class="line">network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</div>
<div class="line">adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</div>
<div class="line">protocols for communication across the network.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</div>
<div class="line">in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. Additional Terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</div>
<div class="line">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</div>
<div class="line">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</div>
<div class="line">be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</div>
<div class="line">that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</div>
<div class="line">apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</div>
<div class="line">under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</div>
<div class="line">this License without regard to the additional permissions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</div>
<div class="line">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</div>
<div class="line">it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</div>
<div class="line">removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</div>
<div class="line">additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</div>
<div class="line">for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</div>
<div class="line">add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</div>
<div class="line">that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</div>
<div class="line">    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</div>
<div class="line">    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</div>
<div class="line">    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</div>
<div class="line">    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</div>
<div class="line">    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</div>
<div class="line">    authors of the material; or</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</div>
<div class="line">    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</div>
<div class="line">    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</div>
<div class="line">    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</div>
<div class="line">    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</div>
<div class="line">    those licensors and authors.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</div>
<div class="line">received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</div>
<div class="line">governed by this License along with a term that is a further</div>
<div class="line">restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</div>
<div class="line">a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</div>
<div class="line">License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</div>
<div class="line">of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</div>
<div class="line">not survive such relicensing or conveying.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</div>
<div class="line">must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</div>
<div class="line">additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</div>
<div class="line">where to find the applicable terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</div>
<div class="line">form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</div>
<div class="line">the above requirements apply either way.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. Termination.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</div>
<div class="line">provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</div>
<div class="line">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</div>
<div class="line">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</div>
<div class="line">paragraph of section 11).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</div>
<div class="line">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</div>
<div class="line">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</div>
<div class="line">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</div>
<div class="line">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</div>
<div class="line">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</div>
<div class="line">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</div>
<div class="line">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</div>
<div class="line">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</div>
<div class="line">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</div>
<div class="line">your receipt of the notice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</div>
<div class="line">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</div>
<div class="line">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</div>
<div class="line">material under section 10.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</div>
<div class="line">run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</div>
<div class="line">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</div>
<div class="line">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</div>
<div class="line">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</div>
<div class="line">modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</div>
<div class="line">not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</div>
<div class="line">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</div>
<div class="line">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</div>
<div class="line">propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</div>
<div class="line">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</div>
<div class="line">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</div>
<div class="line">organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</div>
<div class="line">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</div>
<div class="line">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</div>
<div class="line">licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could</div>
<div class="line">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</div>
<div class="line">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</div>
<div class="line">rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</div>
<div class="line">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</div>
<div class="line">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</div>
<div class="line">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</div>
<div class="line">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</div>
<div class="line">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  11. Patents.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</div>
<div class="line">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</div>
<div class="line">work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</div>
<div class="line">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</div>
<div class="line">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</div>
<div class="line">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</div>
<div class="line">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</div>
<div class="line">consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</div>
<div class="line">purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</div>
<div class="line">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</div>
<div class="line">patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to</div>
<div class="line">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</div>
<div class="line">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</div>
<div class="line">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</div>
<div class="line">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</div>
<div class="line">sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</div>
<div class="line">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</div>
<div class="line">patent against the party.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</div>
<div class="line">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</div>
<div class="line">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</div>
<div class="line">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</div>
<div class="line">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</div>
<div class="line">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</div>
<div class="line">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</div>
<div class="line">license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</div>
<div class="line">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</div>
<div class="line">covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work</div>
<div class="line">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</div>
<div class="line">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</div>
<div class="line">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</div>
<div class="line">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</div>
<div class="line">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</div>
<div class="line">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</div>
<div class="line">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</div>
<div class="line">work and works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</div>
<div class="line">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</div>
<div class="line">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</div>
<div class="line">specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</div>
<div class="line">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</div>
<div class="line">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</div>
<div class="line">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</div>
<div class="line">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</div>
<div class="line">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</div>
<div class="line">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</div>
<div class="line">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</div>
<div class="line">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</div>
<div class="line">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</div>
<div class="line">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</div>
<div class="line">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</div>
<div class="line">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</div>
<div class="line">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</div>
<div class="line">not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</div>
<div class="line">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</div>
<div class="line">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</div>
<div class="line">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</div>
<div class="line">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</div>
<div class="line">under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</div>
<div class="line">combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</div>
<div class="line">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</div>
<div class="line">but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</div>
<div class="line">section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</div>
<div class="line">combination as such.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  14. Revised Versions of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</div>
<div class="line">the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>
<div class="line">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</div>
<div class="line">address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</div>
<div class="line">Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</div>
<div class="line">Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</div>
<div class="line">option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</div>
<div class="line">version or of any later version published by the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</div>
<div class="line">GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</div>
<div class="line">by the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</div>
<div class="line">versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</div>
<div class="line">to choose that version for the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Later license versions may give you additional or different</div>
<div class="line">permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</div>
<div class="line">author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</div>
<div class="line">later version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</div>

<div class="line">            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</div>
<div class="line">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</div>

<div class="line">General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,</div>
<div class="line">other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided</div>
<div class="line">by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line">Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode</div>
<div class="line">of using an interface provided by the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an</div>
<div class="line">Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library</div>
<div class="line">with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked</div>
<div class="line">Version&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the</div>
<div class="line">Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code</div>
<div class="line">for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are</div>
<div class="line">based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the</div>
<div class="line">object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data</div>
<div class="line">and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the</div>
<div class="line">Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License</div>

<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. Conveying Modified Versions.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a</div>
<div class="line">facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application</div>
<div class="line">that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the</div>
<div class="line">facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified</div>
<div class="line">version:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to</div>
<div class="line">   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the</div>
<div class="line">   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs</div>
<div class="line">   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of</div>
<div class="line">   this License applicable to that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from</div>
<div class="line">a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object</div>
<div class="line">code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated</div>
<div class="line">material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure</div>
<div class="line">layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates</div>
<div class="line">(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the</div>
<div class="line">   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</div>
<div class="line">   covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</div>
<div class="line">   document.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. Combined Works.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,</div>
<div class="line">taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the</div>
<div class="line">portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of</div>
<div class="line">the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that</div>
<div class="line">   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</div>
<div class="line">   covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</div>
<div class="line">   document.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during</div>
<div class="line">   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among</div>
<div class="line">   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the</div>
<div class="line">   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   d) Do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this</div>
<div class="line">       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form</div>
<div class="line">       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to</div>
<div class="line">       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of</div>
<div class="line">       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the</div>
<div class="line">       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying</div>
<div class="line">       Corresponding Source.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time</div>
<div class="line">       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer</div>
<div class="line">       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version</div>
<div class="line">       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked</div>
<div class="line">       Version. </div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise</div>
<div class="line">   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the</div>
<div class="line">   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is</div>
<div class="line">   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the</div>
<div class="line">   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the</div>
<div class="line">   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If</div>
<div class="line">   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany</div>
<div class="line">   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application</div>
<div class="line">   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation</div>
<div class="line">   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL</div>
<div class="line">   for conveying Corresponding Source.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. Combined Libraries.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side by side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this</div>
<div class="line">License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your</div>
<div class="line">choice, if you do both of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based</div>
<div class="line">   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,</div>
<div class="line">   conveyed under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it</div>
<div class="line">   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the</div>
<div class="line">   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new</div>
<div class="line">versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</div>
<div class="line">differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the</div>
<div class="line">Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version</div>
<div class="line">of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;</div>
<div class="line">applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that published version or of any later version</div>
<div class="line">published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you</div>
<div class="line">received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide</div>
<div class="line">whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall</div>
<div class="line">apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is</div>
<div class="line">permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
